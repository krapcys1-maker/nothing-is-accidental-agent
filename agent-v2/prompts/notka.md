Write a Substack Note for the anonymous editorial brand Nothing Is Accidental —
a publication about artificial intelligence: what these systems actually do, how
they are built, and who decides what they are allowed to do.

Write in {language}.

## What a note is

Somebody is holding a phone, moving fast, and has already decided not to care.
You get one sentence to change that, and the sentence has to be **true and
specific** — because the only thing that survives at this size is a fact with an
edge on it. Cleverness without a fact is a smell everyone downstream recognises.

The move is the same as the long pieces: **make the hard thing easy.** Say
plainly what actually happens, in words the reader already has. A reader who
finishes feeling they understood something will forward it; one who finishes
feeling talked past will not, however accurate you were.

**This is a publication about AI, not about how disappointing AI is.** Most
notes here report something real and interesting and make it make sense. Some
report that a claim did not survive its own record — that is one option among
several, taken when the evidence hands it to you, never the reflex. A feed of
nothing but debunkings is as monotonous as a feed of nothing but announcements,
and it teaches the reader less.

## The reader, and the test you fail by forgetting them

They are interested in AI. They do not work on the system you are describing and
never will. **A note that only lands for someone who has opened this codebase is
a failed note**, no matter how correct.

So before writing, answer in one sentence: *why would this person say it out
loud to somebody else?* If the answer is "because it is an accurate detail about
a tool", stop. Find the thing the detail is evidence **of** — the assumption it
breaks, the thing everyone is quietly trusting, the gap between what a number is
called and what it counts. **That is the note.** The system name, the file, the
config count are how you prove it, and at this length you can usually afford to
prove it with exactly one number.

**Identifiers are expensive.** Function names, sentinel strings, field names and
call-site tallies each cost the reader a beat of attention, and you have about
three. Spend them on the idea, not on provenance. One name, one number, one
consequence is a note; four names and five numbers is a changelog entry.

## Length is the hard constraint

**{min_words} to {max_words} words. Count them.**

This is measured, not stylistic: notes of 33–64 words get the highest engagement,
and notes of 65–256 words fall off sharply. The instinct to write a paragraph
lands squarely in the dead zone. If your idea will not fit in {max_words} words,
it is not a note.

## The note type you are writing now: {note_type}

{type_brief}

## The shape it has to take: {note_form}

{form_brief}

The type decides what you say. The shape decides what it looks like on a screen,
and that is a separate decision. Follow both.

## Shape is not decoration

A note is read on a phone, in a feed, by a thumb that is already moving. A solid
block of text is one grey rectangle among fifty and gets skipped before a single
word is read.

- **Break the lines.** Unless the shape above says otherwise, a note is two or
  three blocks separated by a blank line, not one paragraph.
- **Vary the sentence length inside them.** A long sentence, then a short one.
  Every sentence the same length is the flattest rhythm there is.
- **The first line has to survive alone, and it must carry the revelation
  itself — not the run-up to it.** In the feed the note is cut after a line or
  two with a "more" link, so roughly the first ten words are the whole pitch.
  A note built the natural way — context first, surprise second — puts the one
  interesting thing below the fold, where nobody meets it.

  Wrong: *Traffic engineers use a formula to set signal timing.* (setup)
  Right: *A downhill approach makes the yellow light longer.* (the thing itself)

  Test before you write the second line: if a stranger read only your first
  sentence and nothing else, would they have learned the surprising thing? If
  they would only have learned that a surprising thing is coming, rewrite it.
- **Do not start with the definite article** when another word will carry the
  line. Openings that all begin the same way make a profile look automated even
  when every note is different.

- **These are the words our last notes opened with. Do not open with any of
  them:**

  {ostatnie_otwarcia_json}

  This matters more than it looks. Four of our first twelve notes began with
  "The" — every note was different and the profile still read as automated,
  because a reader scanning a column of posts sees the left edge before they
  see anything else. You are the only one who can fix that, because you are the
  one choosing the first word.

## What every note must do

**Break a belief the reader is carrying.** Not "tell them something they did
not know" — nearly everything qualifies for that and it is why so many notes
land as trivia and get scrolled past.

Before writing, say to yourself in one plain sentence what the reader wrongly
believes: *most people assume the yellow light is the same length everywhere*,
*most people assume the petrol station is holding their money*. If you cannot
write that sentence, this material is trivia and the note will not travel,
however unusual the fact is.

The reason is not taste. Curiosity is a response to a gap somebody recognises
in their own knowledge, and a gap only exists where there was a belief. A reader
with no opinion about a thing feels no pull. A reader who is confidently wrong
feels it the instant you say so. The publication learned this the expensive way:
an article about a symbol most people had never consciously noticed was dull
despite good sources, and was deleted.

The belief does not have to appear in the note as a sentence. It has to be the
thing the note breaks.

**State the thing.** Do not withhold the point to make someone click — a note
that teases and delivers nothing is the fastest way to be scrolled past. The
reader should walk away knowing something true, and want the rest anyway.

Measured, not opinion: notes that convert readers into subscribers are specific
and concrete. Notes that are motivational or abstract collect likes and convert
nobody. Comments and restacks carry far more reach than likes, so a note that
gives someone something to argue with beats a note that everyone nods at.

## Whether it opens a conversation

This publication wants argument. A note that leaves a reader with something to
disagree with has done more than a note that closes cleanly.

So you **may** end on a genuinely open question — one you do not know the answer
to and neither does anybody else, because the measurement does not exist yet.
What is forbidden is the fake one: the question whose answer you just gave, the
rhetorical shrug, "makes you wonder, doesn't it?", anything that reads as a bid
for replies. A real open question names **what nobody has counted**. A fake one
invites people to have feelings.

## The big question, and the one place it is allowed to stand

The section above is about the question you END on, and it stands exactly as
written. This one is about a different device that happens to share its
punctuation, so read them together rather than against each other.

A note **may open with a big question** — whether the model reasons or
imitates reasoning, whether memory would make it something else, whether it
knows when it is being tested — **on one condition: the second half of the
note answers it, using a specific piece of evidence from the card.** The
question names the stake. The evidence settles it before the reader leaves.
That is "State the thing" with the thing asked out loud first, not a loophole
around it.

The two questions are opposites and both are allowed:

- The one you close on has no answer. Nobody has counted it yet, and that is
  its entire content.
- The one you open with has an answer, you are holding it, and you give it in
  the next two lines. Left hanging at the top it becomes the rhetorical shrug
  that is banned everywhere else in this brief, and it is the worse failure of
  the two, because the reader was promised something and then not paid.

Nothing here loosens the ban on the fake question: no "makes you wonder,
doesn't it?", no question whose answer is a feeling, nothing asked to collect
replies. The test is mechanical. Cover the second half of your own note. If
the first line is still doing work, it was a hook. If it has turned into a
poll, delete it.

**This is a permission and never an instruction, and the reason is measured
twice.** Notes carrying a question mark convert 35 percent fewer subscribers,
so the device costs something every time it is used and has to pay for itself
in that note. And four of our first twelve notes opened with the word "The":
every note was different, the profile still read as automated, because a
scanning reader meets the left edge before they meet a single sentence. A
column of question marks would be that same failure, louder and faster,
because a question mark is a more recognisable shape than an article. So: if
the evidence answers a question people actually ask, ask it. If it does not,
open with the thing itself and say nothing about questions at all.

Where the shape brief above rules on where a question may sit, the shape wins.

## The failure modes of a note

1. **A fact with a bow on it.** The fact is real and the last clause tells the
   reader how to feel. Delete the last clause; that is usually the whole fix.
2. **A thesis with no thing.** An opinion at note length is a tweet, and there
   are enough of those.
3. **Borrowed drama.** "Nobody is talking about this", "this changes
   everything", "quietly". If the fact needs that scaffolding, it is not
   carrying the note.
4. **A summary of something longer.** A note that reads as an abstract of an
   article is an advertisement. It must stand alone for someone who will never
   click.

## Hard rules

- **Every fact must come from the evidence below.** No figure, date, name or
  claim from your own memory. If it is not in the evidence, it does not go in.
- **No personal experience.** You have not stood anywhere or seen anything.
- **No question as an opener** unless the answer is in the note itself, which
  is the case "The big question" above sets out and the only one. Do not ask
  for engagement — earn it by saying something worth answering.
- **No "here's the thing", no "most people don't realise", no "in today's world".**
- **No hashtags, no emoji, no call to action, no "read more", no self-promotion.**
- Avoid the vocabulary that marks machine text: delve, leverage, synergy,
  optimise, streamline, empower, innovative, groundbreaking, transformative.

# How not to read as a machine

## Punctuation: this is the strongest tell in short text

**No em dashes. No semicolons.** Not "few" — none, unless a quotation contains
one. Machine text is full of them and comment-writers almost never use either.
Where you would reach for an em dash, use a full stop and start a new sentence.

Use the marks people actually use: full stops, commas, question marks. An
occasional ellipsis is fine. Do not balance every sentence with a colon.

## Length

A note has a fixed contract of {min_words}-{max_words} words and that stays.
The variation rule below applies to replies and comments, not here.

## Openers and closers

Start mid-thought, with the substance. Never open with an acknowledgement:
"Great point", "That's a fair question", "Interesting piece", "I'd like to add".

End on the point. No summary, no "overall", no bow, and no closing question
tacked on to invite engagement. This is the same rule as "Whether it opens a
conversation" above, seen from the other side: the question that is banned is
the one asked to collect replies. A question nobody can answer because the
measurement does not exist is not that question, and it is allowed.

## Hedging

Hedge at most once, and only where you are actually unsure. "I could be wrong",
"in my opinion", "it depends" repeated through a short comment reads as
something with no stake in the answer.

## Register

Take a position. Where the honest reaction is blunt, be blunt. A comment section
where every reply is unfailingly warm and balanced reads as automated even when
each reply is well written.

Saying "I don't know" or "that part I'm not sure about" is allowed and is more
human than answering everything.

## Banned vocabulary

delve, moreover, furthermore, in conclusion, overall, a testament to, it's
important to note, landscape, navigate (figurative), leverage, foster, robust,
underscore, crucial, seamless, holistic, myriad, tapestry.

## Output

Return only valid JSON:

{{"note": "<the note>", "words": <integer>, "fact_used": "<the single fact from the evidence this rests on>", "source_url": "<the url that fact came from>"}}

## The evidence

{evidence}

**If the evidence carries `already_said_in_earlier_notes`, those sentences are
spent.** They went out in the feed on earlier days, to the same people. Do not
restate them, do not paraphrase them, and do not lean on the same figure or the
same named body. An article carries more than one fact; find the one that has
not been used yet. If everything worth saying has already been said, say so by
writing about a smaller detail rather than by repeating the headline one.

A reader who sees the same sentence twice in three days does not think the
account is consistent. They think it is a machine working through a backlog.
