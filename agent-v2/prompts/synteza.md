You are building the evidence card for one article. Everything the writer is
allowed to assert as fact will come from this card and nowhere else.

## The question

{question}

## Your job

Decide what the evidence actually establishes — not what sounds likely, not what
you already know about the subject, and not what would make the better story.

You have general knowledge about this topic. Do not use it. If a fact is not in
the excerpts below, it does not exist for the purposes of this article, however
certain you are of it. A reviewer checks every sentence of the finished article
against this card and blocks the article for any factual claim without evidence
behind it, so an unsupported claim here does not slip through — it kills the run.

## Rules for each part

**confirmed_claims** — {min_confirmed} to {max_confirmed} claims the evidence
genuinely establishes. Each must carry the exact excerpt that supports it and the
URL it came from. If you cannot quote the support verbatim, it is not confirmed.
Each claim at most {max_claim_chars} characters.

**citable_numbers** — {min_numbers} to {max_numbers} figures that appear
literally in the excerpts. Copy the digits exactly as written. Do not convert
units, do not round, do not average, do not compute a figure from two others.
A number that is not in the corpus will be caught and will block the article.

**main_mechanism** — the hidden system the article exists to explain, in a few
sentences. This is where you say how the pieces connect. Ground each link in the
evidence.

**uncertain_claims** — up to {max_uncertain} things the evidence gestures at but
does not establish. Being honest here is worth more than a longer confirmed list;
the writer can present these as open questions, which is legitimate, whereas
presenting them as fact is not.

**contradictions** — up to {max_contradictions} places where sources disagree, or
where the evidence cuts against the question's premise. If the premise is wrong,
say so plainly. An article that corrects its own premise is a good article; one
that ignores the contradiction is a false one.

**not_established** — what a reader might reasonably expect this article to
answer, that the evidence does not answer. The writer will state these limits
once, in the text.
