Rank these candidate facts against each other, strongest first, and say which
ones this publication should throw away.

Nothing Is Accidental is a publication **about artificial intelligence**: what
these systems actually do, how they are built, who decides what they are allowed
to do, and what that arrangement hands the people who built it.

## You are RANKING, not scoring

Put them in order, best to worst. Every position is different — there are no
ties and there is no "all of these are good".

This is deliberate. Asked to score things one by one, a model gives almost
everything the same high mark and the ranking carries no information. Asked to
put them in order, it has to decide. So the order is the answer; a number would
not be.

## What makes one stronger than another

In roughly this order of weight:

1. **A stranger would stop scrolling for it.** Not "this is important" — would
   somebody who does not work in this field read the second sentence?
2. **It is checkable and the check would be interesting.** A specific figure, a
   named document, a measurement somebody ran.
3. **It explains a mechanism the reader has met without understanding.** Why the
   answer arrives that fast, why the middle of a long chat is forgotten, why one
   provider's bill is five times another's for the same model.
4. **The consequence reaches the reader.** Something they hold, pay, wait for or
   are judged by — not something that happens to an industry.
5. **It is not the news everybody already ran.** A model launch that three
   channels covered this week is not a finding.

## What to throw away — and the bar is high, on purpose

Throwing away is **permanent**. The candidate was paid for, and once it is gone
it never comes back. Keeping a mediocre one costs a single further look.

So `wyrzuc: true` is for things that are **definitionally not ours**, never for
things that are merely weaker than their neighbours. Weaker belongs at the
bottom of the order — that is what the order is for.

There are exactly three grounds, and you must name which one applies by its
code. You are choosing from a list of three, not writing a sentence — if none
of the three fits, the candidate is not being thrown away.

- **`NOT_AI`** — not about artificial intelligence. The most common one and the
  least forgivable. A fact about pharmaceutical regulation, food labelling or
  car dealerships is not our subject however good it is. Judge the SUBJECT, not
  whether the word "AI" appears somewhere in the sentence.
- **`NOTHING_TO_CHECK`** — an opinion, a forecast, a claim about what people
  believe, or a figure with no source behind it.
- **`NO_MECHANISM`** — it says what happened and cannot say what makes it so,
  not even badly. **Read the candidate's own `decision` line before choosing
  this one.** Every candidate here already passed a gate that measured that
  line, so if it names a decision, a measurement, a constraint or a trade-off,
  this ground does not apply and the code will refuse the deletion.

**Do NOT throw away for being widely covered, for being a product launch, or
for being less interesting than the others.** Those are ranking judgements and
they go into the order.

This rule exists because of a real loss. A candidate about a company's first
custom inference chip was discarded as "a widely covered product launch" — and
the fact carried, inside it, that the chip was designed in about nine months
when custom silicon normally takes years. That is a mechanism, and it went in
the bin with the press release. Bury a launch at the bottom of the order if you
must; do not delete it.

## Which ones could carry a whole article

An article runs about a thousand words, so it needs more than a complete fact:
it needs **a second act** (something happened after — a reversal, a court case,
an amendment, a company changing course) **or reach beyond one place** (the same
arrangement runs in another company, country or product).

A fact with neither is a good note and a bad article: complete in two sentences,
and a thousand words of it would be padding. Most candidates are notes. Say so.

**This is a selection, not a verdict on each one in turn.** Asked candidate by
candidate whether something could carry a thousand words, almost everything gets
a yes — measured here at two thirds of the bank, in batches where the honest
answer was a handful. So pick: **at most a third of the list**, and only where
you can name the second act or the second place out loud. Anything past that
share is cut by the order anyway, strongest kept, so a generous list does not
help the candidates in it — it only hides which ones you actually meant.

## Output

Return only valid JSON. `kolejnosc` lists every id exactly once, strongest
first. Do not omit any id and do not invent one.

{{"kolejnosc": [<id>, <id>, ...],
  "oceny": [{{"id": <id>, "wyrzuc": true|false, "kod_wyrzucenia": "NOT_AI"|"NOTHING_TO_CHECK"|"NO_MECHANISM"|"", "powod_wyrzucenia": "<one clause saying why that code applies, empty when keeping>", "na_artykul": true|false, "dlaczego_mocny": "<one clause — what would make a stranger stop>"}}]}}

`kod_wyrzucenia` must be one of the three codes whenever `wyrzuc` is true, and
empty otherwise. A deletion with any other value is refused and the candidate is
kept — so a code you cannot honestly pick is a candidate you are not deleting.
